#Assumptions:
1. Provided JSON is chronological 
2. Homepage is http://foo.bar.com/p1. 
3. Cross-linking: Any link without a parent reference is error
4. Links repeated more than once are skipped
5. Links missing from success cannot be reached, dead links

#Approach 
Starting from Homepage, 
Crawl every links on the JSON File. 
Skip nodes which is not a parent 
Skip already visited nodes 
Once success pages are visited, identify error pages that are ignored, not linked to Homepage.
